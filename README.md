# CS4450-Project

Our project creates a parser for Python3 using the Java Library of ANTLR for implementation. The grammar handles variable assignments, arithmentic expressions, booleans, arrays, if/elif/else blocks, for/while loops, and comments.

## Team Members

1. Ben Flink
2. Collin Folkman
3. Meredith Payne

## Setup and Requirements

Since we are using ANTLR, there are two ways to run the parser.
The first is to visit lab.antlr.org, copy in the contents of ParserProject.g4, copy in the test cases, delete the contents of the lexer tab, and run the program.
The second would be to set up ANTLR on a computer. This method allows for the additional files we have included in the github repository. We have attached the pdf file that we were provided by Dr. Ekin.

## Collaboration Statements

Deliverable 1 - All work was done in collaboration in-person. Contribution was equal between all three members. We found it easier to do it this way as opposed to splitting things up and working individually.

Deliverable 2 - We operated under the same collaboration style as in deliverable 1. All work was completed during in person collaboration.

Deliverable 3 - We operated under the same collaboration style as in the previous 2 deliverables. All work was completed during in person collaboration.
